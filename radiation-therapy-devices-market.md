<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiation Therapy</li><li>Internal Beam RadiOthersapy</li><li>Stereotactic Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation therapy devices encompass various treatments for cancer, primarily categorized into three types. External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) delivers high-energy beams from outside the body, targeting tumors with precision. Internal Beam Radiation Therapy, or brachytherapy, involves placing radioactive materials directly inside or near the tumor for localized treatment. Stereotactic technology enhances precision by using advanced imaging to deliver focused radiation beams accurately, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Together, these technologies improve patient outcomes in cancer care.</p></p>
